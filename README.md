# BCG Data Science Job Simulation
This repository contains my completed work for the BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program on Forage. The simulation provided hands-on experience in real-world data science tasks similar to those performed by BCG consultants.

🚀 Project Overview
Through this job simulation, I applied data science techniques to analyze business problems, generate insights, and provide data-driven recommendations.

🔍 Key Learning Outcomes<br>
1. Improved ability to clean and preprocess raw business data for meaningful analysis.<br>
2. Strengthened understanding of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.<br>
3. Enhanced skills in using Python for data science tasks, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.<br>
4. Gained hands-on experience in visualizing data and presenting insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.<br>
5. Developed problem-solving skills by applying data-driven methodologies to real-world consulting scenarios.<br>

✅ Tasks Completed:
### Task 1
  - Use Python to analyze client data <br>
  - Create data visualizations to help you interpret key trends
### Task 2
  - Use Python to build a new feature for your analysis
### Task 3
  - Build a predictive model for churn using a random forest technique
### Task 4
  - Write an executive summary with your findings

📊 Technologies Used:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Jupyter Notebook

📌 Project Summary
The project involved analyzing business data to uncover trends, make predictions, and support strategic decision-making using machine learning and data visualization techniques. The key focus areas included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and business insights.
