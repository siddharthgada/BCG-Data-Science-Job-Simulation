# BCG Data Science Job Simulation
This repository contains my completed work for the BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program on Forage. The simulation provided hands-on experience in real-world data science tasks similar to those performed by BCG consultants.

Project Overview
Through this job simulation, I applied data science techniques to analyze business problems, generate insights, and provide data-driven recommendations.

Key Learning Outcomes
📌 Improved ability to clean and preprocess raw business data for meaningful analysis.<br>
📌 Strengthened understanding of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.<br>
📌 Enhanced skills in using Python for data science tasks, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.<br>
📌 Gained hands-on experience in visualizing data and presenting insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.<br>
📌 Developed problem-solving skills by applying data-driven methodologies to real-world consulting scenarios.<br>

Tasks Completed:
## Task 1
✅ Use Python to analyze client data <br>
✅ Create data visualizations to help you interpret key trends
## Task 2
✅ Use Python to build a new feature for your analysis
## Task 3
✅ Build a predictive model for churn using a random forest technique
## Task 4
✅ Write an executive summary with your findings

Technologies Used:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Jupyter Notebook
