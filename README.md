# BCG Data Science Job Simulation
This repository contains my completed work for the BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program on Forage. The simulation provided hands-on experience in real-world data science tasks similar to those performed by BCG consultants.

Project Overview
Through this job simulation, I applied data science techniques to analyze business problems, generate insights, and provide data-driven recommendations.

Tasks Completed:
## Task 1
✅ Use Python to analyze client data <br>
✅ Create data visualizations to help you interpret key trends
## Task 2
✅ Use Python to build a new feature for your analysis
## Task 3
✅ Build a predictive model for churn using a random forest technique
## Task 4
✅ Write an executive summary with your findings using a PowerPoint Slide

Technologies Used:
1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Data Visualization Tools
4. About Forage & BCG Simulation
